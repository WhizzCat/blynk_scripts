A collection of scripts for using with Blynk on a local server, in case you want to run your own cloud.

The two scripts can be used individually, but note that the update.sh script tries to restart you Blynk server after updating and tries to kill it with the same script.

Change the COMMAND parameter in blynk.sh and be aware of the paths. This is how I run them on my own system, but your Java could be somewhere else, aswell as the Blynk.jar file ;)
